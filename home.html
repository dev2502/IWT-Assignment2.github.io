		Today Is “National Take Your Dog to Work Day”
	</h1>
	<p>
 		This is the day to take your dog to you work. If you’re lucky enough to 		work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog to Work Day.” But most 		people aren’t, so today is the one day a year that many companies allow 		their employees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces are so 		fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round!While it’s obviously not 		recommended for dogs to be brought to work sites that are dangerous for 		them or where they’ll get in the way, such as an operating room or a 		factory floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.
